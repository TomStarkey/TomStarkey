## About Me
As a self-motivated and hardworking individual, I have completed a Python Programming course at HyperionDev, where I gained proficiency in key programming concepts such as *variables, data structures, functions, and **Object-Oriented Programming***. My ability to think analytically and solve complex problems has been consistently demonstrated throughout my software engineer skills bootcamp, where I successfully completed 15 technical tasks focused on Python development.

I have always enjoyed *problem solving and analysis*, choosing scientific, logic-based subjects over the humanities at school. In my free time I enjoy completing escape rooms and playing games to satisfy my desire for puzzle solving.

I have a *broad range of experience* in my career, starting as an activities instructor in sailing, windsurfing, climbing, and other outdoor activities. These roles have given me *experience and soft skills required for working in **educational and team settings***.

🔭 I've previously worked in the Outdoor Education industry as an Instructor. Following this I worked as a Technical Clerk at Wood PLC, where I applied my programming skills to streamline administrative tasks and develop a data validation script.

🌱 I’m currently looking to progress my career in Administration, Data Management and Analysis, or Software Development.

📝 Interesting fact about me: I recently spent a year travelling through tours, backpacking, and campervanning with my wife. My favourite places included Thailand, Peru, and Norway, and I really enjoyed getting into the history of all the places that I have been to. During this time I read Simon Sebag Montefiore's monstorous book "The World, A Family History" and the podcast series "Empires" and nerding out on niche history has become a passion of mine alongside programming.

## Software Development Bootcamp Portfolio
For the completion of the HyperionDev Software Development Bootcamp I completed 15 tasks in Python. These can be accessed at this link: https://www.hyperiondev.com/portfolio/148228/
