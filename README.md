## About Me
As a self-motivated and hardworking individual, I have completed a Python Programming course at HyperionDev, where I gained proficiency in key programming concepts such as *variables, data structures, functions, and **Object-Oriented Programming***. My ability to think analytically and solve complex problems has been consistently demonstrated throughout my software engineer skills bootcamp, where I successfully completed 15 technical tasks focused on Python development.

I have always enjoyed *problem solving and analysis*, choosing scientific, logic-based subjects over the humanities at school. In my free time I enjoy completing escape rooms and playing games to satisfy my desire for puzzle solving.

I have a *broad range of experience* in my career, starting as an activities instructor in sailing, windsurfing, climbing, and other outdoor activities. These roles have given me *experience and soft skills required for working in **educational and team settings***.

ðŸ”­ I've previously worked in the Outdoor Education industry as an Instructor. I am now an Aspiring Software Engineer.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Software Engineering Fundamentals with HyperionDev.
